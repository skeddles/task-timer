# Task Timer

This is a simple productivity app I made for myself to help keep myself focused. It's a timer that stays open over your screen and reminds you to stay on task.

### Features:
- Set timer to any amount in minutes
- See live countdown
- Stays on top of other windows
- Red border shows on your screen to remind you
- Occasional beeps and shakes to remind you 

## Problems

Sometimes when you open it, you just get a white screen. Try waiting a few seconds, or minimizing it. 

If you have any other problems, please open an issue here on github.

## Other Info

Sorry the exe is so big (40MB). The app was created with javascript and packaged with electron / electron-builder.
